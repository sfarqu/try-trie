# Try a Trie

This is a toy project to test the performance of various implementations of a trieâ€”a cool but very-nearly-useless data structure.

The first attempts were made in a coding exercise site, and I was curious why using Optionals was slower.
I want to explore more efficient ways of building a trie, as well as learn to use Rust.
